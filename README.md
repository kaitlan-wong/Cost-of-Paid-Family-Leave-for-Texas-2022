# Cost-of-Paid-Family-Leave-for-Texas-2022
This analysis estimates the cost to Texas for paid parental leave using ACS data. There are three scenarios calculated:

1)     Plan A:  a 100% wage replacement up to the BLS 2023 average salary of $61,320. So the weekly wage replacement, regardless of your income, caps out at the 2023 weekly salary of $1,117.69.  (this is our ideal proposal)

2)     Plan B: a 90% wage replacement up to the BLS 2023 average salary of $61,320 annual/$1,117.69. (this is a compromise proposal). Weekly wage replacement capped at 90% avg salary.

3)     Plan C; 80% wage replacement up to the BLS average salary of $61,320/$1,117.69, wage replacement capped at80%  avg. salary.
